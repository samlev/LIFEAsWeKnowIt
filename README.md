LIFE as we know it
==================
*A Cellular Automaton experiment.*

#### What is this?

This is a [Cellular Automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) experiment, loosely based on
[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). I made it in an afternoon because
I wanted to explore the concepts of mortality and fertility applying to cell age.

#### But why?

I've made a number of experiments with CGoL in the past, from a pretty shitty attempt at
[porting it into 3D](http://gameoflife.samuellevy.com/), to turning it into a
[competitive multiplayer game](http://gameoflifetotalwar.com/). I like experimenting with the edges of the core
concept, and exploring what's possible with small variations to the basic rule set.

#### Can I see this without having to clone it?

Sure. [Here it is](https://samlev.github.io/LIFEAsWeKnowIt/).

#### This is... pretty ugly...

Yes. It was built in an afternoon, with no real care about making it pretty. It works, though, and you can play
with the settings to find a way that works best. I'm mostly a backend developer - other people know how to make
things pretty, but I know how to make things work.

#### There's a distinct lack of error checking...

So... don't break it? Or do? I don't care. It works fine with the parameters that are in the the file, but feel
free to experiment with them. If it breaks, it's not like anything particularly bad will happen.

#### Who are you?

I'm Sam. I'm a web developer. I run a small company called
[Determined Development](https://www.determineddevelopment.com). You can hire me if you'd like. I specialize in
PHP development, but I'm also pretty handy with python, JavaScript, and a bunch of other languages. I also have
a [blog](http://blog.samuellevy.com/) that I rarely update.

#### Will you accept pull requests?

Maybe? Depends on the request. I mean... this was an afternoon project, so I don't care that much about it. It
was just a bit of fun that I thought others might enjoy.
